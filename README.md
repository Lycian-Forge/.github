### **About Us**  
**Lycian Forge** is an indie game studio born in 2024, founded by three engineer buddies who realized they were better at crafting games than fixing printers.

We don’t just make games – we make heart-racing, edge-of-your-seat adventures that’ll have you laughing and swearing at the same time. Welcome to Lycian Forge, where we forge games that ignite **pure fun**!

### **Our Team**  
We’re a small but passionate team of engineers-turned-game-developers who believe in the power of creativity, caffeine, and a little bit of madness.  

- **The Visionary** – The one with the big ideas (and the whiteboard full of scribbles).  
- **The Code Wizard** – Turns coffee into code and dreams into reality.  
- **The Pixel Artist** – Makes everything look awesome (and occasionally fixes the printer).  
- **The Intern** – Helps where she can, learns along the way.
