## 👥 Our Team

We're a small but mighty team of engineers-turned-game-devs, driven by creativity, coffee, and a healthy dose of madness.

* **The Visionary:** The architect of grand ideas (and the keeper of the scribbled whiteboard).
* **The Code Wizard:** Transforms the power that comes from his ADHD into code and dreams into digital realities.
* **The Pixel Artist:** Makes everything visually stunning (and occasionally unjams the printer).
* **The Intern:** A versatile learner, contributing wherever possible (also, has the skills to make amazing tea.)
